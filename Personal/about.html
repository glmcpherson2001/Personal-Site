        <p class="about-text">
          Iâ€™m an Eastern Illinois University student majoring in Computer
          Information Technologies. I am interested in backend development and
          Data Engineering because I love to streamline processes and systems to
          make people's lives easier. My strengths are problem-solving,
          communication, and having high attention to detail. I enjoy playing
          video games, riding my bicycle, and watching anime at an inhumane
          speed. My values include putting people first above all else, empathy
          extremely important when interacting with others, and having integrity
          in your actions and ideals. I have a lot of experience in customer
          service and have held a management position at a restaurant for a few
          years. My strong technical knowledge, good teamworking skills, and
          adaptability allows me to finish what I strive to do while working
          with a team with varying backgrounds.
